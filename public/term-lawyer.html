<p>v)              at the controller&rsquo;s written direction delete or return personal data and copies thereof to the processor on termination of the agreement unless required by Applicable Law to store the personal data (and for these purposes the term "delete" shall mean to put such data beyond use); and&nbsp;</p>
<p>vi)            maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this section 8 and immediately inform the controller if in the processor&rsquo;s opinion an instruction infringes the Data Protection Legislation.&nbsp;</p>
