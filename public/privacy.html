<p><strong>Marketing </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. [We have the established following personal data control mechanisms]:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Promotional offers from us </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). &nbsp;</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased [goods or services] from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third-party marketing </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opting out</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time [by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences <strong>OR</strong> by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you <strong>OR</strong> by contacting us at any time]. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Such measures shall include, but are not limited to, having Data Processing Agreements with applicable sub processors, and ensuring that such sub processors have adequate security and data protection procedures in place aligned with the GDPR or any other applicable data protection law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK. &nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any payment transactions [carried out by us or our chosen third-party provider of payment processing services] will be encrypted using Stripe. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of Our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are set out in the table [<em>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</em>] above].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [<em>your legal rights</em>] below for further information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. &nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You can unsubscribe from any marketing communication by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the communication (usually in the footer section), or send Your request to [help@wooqlaw.com]. Under the European General Data Protection Regulation (also known as &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) You also have rights which include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request access </strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request correction </strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can exercise these rights by sending an email to us at [ help@wooqlaw.com ].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we may need from you</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.&nbsp;</p>
